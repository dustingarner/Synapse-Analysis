# Synapse-Analysis
This program allows easy analysis based on synapses of Flywire.

The programs are based on annotationframeworkclient, which requires a "token" for use. Each user must generate a client token by using Block 2 of FrameworkClientExamples. Go to the link to retrieve your token and paste it in the quotes of Block 3 to have it save to your computer. Every time you run Block 2 it invalidates the previous token, so if you need to use the program on multiple computers, use the same token.

FlyWireSynapseTutorial was created by the FlyWire team and explains different uses of the client framework.

Dustin's Synapse Analysis contains all of the forms of analysis that can be done using Neuron IDs and Regions. Some analysis requires a spreadsheet containing the region boundaries and other analysis requires a text document including a list of Neuron IDs. Examples of these files are provided in the repository.
